completed challenge for mooqita

Hi there this is my first time on git and new on bash/linux program

My first bash file rlfs.sh (random lines file size) it creates a *.txt file that fill it with random 15 character lines (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
and when it reach the size number it stop creating those randoms lines.
After that point it sort the lines and then if there is lines that start a character from a.... or A.....
then remove them and creater a new file with the result without the removed lines.
At the end compare the files and check how many lines where been removed from the original file and show the results.
